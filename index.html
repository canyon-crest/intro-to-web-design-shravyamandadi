        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="images/poway.jpg" alt="Poway,CA" id="pic1">
            I was born at a young age in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poway,_California" target="_blank">Poway, California</a>. 
            Here I lived for the next <span class="highlight">5 years</span> of my life before moving to San Diego 
            where I began my educational endeavors. I attended Solana Ranch Elementary school, and then went to Pacific Trails Middle School. 
            Over the last 12 years, through my transitions through different schools, I have lived in the same house, though I will not disclose the address.

        <h3>Now</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="images/chemistry.png" alt="Beaker" id="pic2">
            Currently, I am 15 years old and a sophomore at 
            <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>. 
            This semester, I am taking world history, CSP, calc ab, and chemistry. Next semester, I will be taking environmental science, english, calc bc, and AP chem. 
            I’m really enjoying the classes I’ve taken this semester and I am looking forward to my classes in the spring, 
            <span class="highlight">especially chemistry</span>. In my opinion, the classes I am taking this year are much more exciting than the ones I took last year as a freshman.

        <h3>Chipotle</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="images/chipotle.jpeg" alt="Chipotle" id="pic3">
            My favorite restaurant is 
            <a href="https://www.chipotle.com/" target="_blank">Chipotle</a>. 
            I usually get a burrito bowl with rice, chicken and black beans,
            <span class="highlight">never guacamole</span>, since it does not add enough to the dish to justify the extra cost. 
            I like Chipotle because it offers a wide variety of options to choose from. I also enjoy the flexibility of its options and how you get to customize your order so much. 
            I would definitely recommend trying it out if you have never been — it is definitely a memorable experience!
